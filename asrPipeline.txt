In the asrPipeline.txt file, we have collected a diverse set of transcripts that include various speech patterns such as sentences spoken at different speeds, with stuttering, code-switching, and more. These transcripts were carefully chosen to test the robustness and adaptability of our chosen Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system.

To collect the sounds, we recorded speakers with different accents, languages, and speaking styles to create a comprehensive dataset that reflects the challenges encountered in real-world speech recognition tasks. We ensured that the recordings were of high quality, with minimal background noise and distortion, to evaluate the ASR system's performance accurately.

We used [ASR system name], a state-of-the-art ASR system, to convert the collected audio files into text. This system is known for its ability to handle a variety of speech patterns and languages effectively.

Upon evaluating the performance of the ASR system on our dataset, we observed the following:

The system performed well in accurately transcribing speech spoken at a normal pace and with clear enunciation. It was also proficient in recognizing common words and phrases in both the primary language and instances of code-switching.

The ASR system faced challenges when dealing with speech that included stuttering, filler words, or repetitive phrases. It occasionally misinterpreted or omitted these elements in the transcriptions.

In cases where neighboring words had blurred boundaries or when sentences were spoken very fast, the system's performance was less accurate. It sometimes merged words together or misinterpreted the intended words.

While the system showed proficiency in handling code-switching, it occasionally struggled with accurately transcribing slang, regional dialects, or less common words from the secondary language.

In conclusion, the ASR system performed well in general, but faced difficulties in specific scenarios, such as dealing with fast speech, blurred word boundaries, stuttering, and some code-switching instances. Further improvements to the system could focus on addressing these challenges to enhance its overall performance and adaptability.
